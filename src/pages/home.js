				<h3>Hi, I'm Pere ðŸ‘‹</h3>
				<h2>
					Software Engineer React and Web developer. <br />
					Bringing Your Ideas to Reality
				</h2>
				<p>
					{' '}
					My full name is Joel Oyinperebo Kada, I am from Bayelsa state, but I
					was born and brought up in the city of Lagos.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					I studied computer science in the University of Benin. I have always
					had a passion for computers, technology and I have always been
					capitvated by the puruit of knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					So as one does, I chose this path completely blind to the challanges
					of software engineering. I started with learning HTML on my phone,
					because I was told that I could do the amazing things I saw on the
					internet by myself.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					But I wasn't truly hooked until I picked up Javascript and Django with
					Python. By my first <b> "Hello World " </b>console log, I knew I had
					found my passion in life and I was sure I would do whatever i needed
					to to follow this passion. I am a self taught programmer (Yes, that
					means youtube videosðŸ˜‰) with 4 years of experience in frontend web
					development.
				</p>
				<p>
					{' '}
					<b> My goal ?</b> <br /> To keep refining my skills, staying updated
					with the latest tech, and collaborating with companies and individuals
					to brng their ideas to life on the web.
